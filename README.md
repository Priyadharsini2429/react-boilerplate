# React-Boilerplate
Quickly get started with React and Flux using Browserify, Gulp and Babel

## This Boilerplate gives you the following:

- React, React Router, and Flux for ultra-responsive UI development  
- Browserify bundling  
- jQuery with Bootstrap for styling  
- Gulp build that:  
  - compiles JSX and latest javascript using Babel   
  - bundles JS and CSS files  
  - migrates the built app to the dist folder  
  - runs a dev webserver and hot reloading

## To get started: 

- Install [NodeJS](http://www.nodejs.org)  
- Download this repo 
- Open the command line of your choice and cd to the root directory of this repo on your machine and execute following three commands
- `npm install` - Installs packages
- `npm install -g gulp` - Installs gulp globally if already not. [Why globally?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22115400/why-do-we-need-to-install-gulp-globally-and-locally)
- `gulp` - Builds the project and opens your browser.
- Navigate to [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) if your browser doesn't open automatically.
